# Benchmarking the ArrayStrand implementation

## Show that ArrayStrand.cutAndSplice() is O(N)
Record your response here.
All statements within the method are constant until a for-loop is reached, where
the recombinant DNA strand is being made. Both statements within the for-loop are of
constant time complexity, and therefore the portion of the method with the largest impact
on runtime would be the for-loop. As we discussed in class single loops that will iterate 
at worst N amount of times has a time complexity of O(N).

# Verifying the LinkedStrand implementation

## Show that LinkedStrand.cutAndSplice() is O(1)
Record your response here.
It is O(1) in respect to the size of the splice. This was accomplished by using assignment statements and 
controlling how the strings were manipulated. The method itself is O(N) depending on the amount of binding sites,
but this is allowed according to the instruction sheet.
