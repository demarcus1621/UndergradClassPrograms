Half-Adder:
in_a	in_b	result	carry_out
0		0		0		0
0		1		1		0
1		0		1		0
1		1		0		1
This can be made with an AND gate to compute the carry_out
and a XOR gate for result.

Full-Adder:
carry_in	in_a	in_b	result	carry_out
0			0		0		0		0
0			0		1		1		0
0			1		0		1		0
0			1		1		0		1
1			0		0		1		0
1			0		1		0		1
1			1		0		0		1
1			1		1		1		1
Having a full-adder in a circuit introduces
