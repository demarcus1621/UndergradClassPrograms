Desktop - single user, performance
Laptop - performance, limited battery/heat disipation issues
Mobile - heavily limited on power
Embedded/IOT - physical size, very low power
Cluster - 
GPU - 

Classes of Parallelism
-----------------------
Instruction level parallelism
Task/Thread parallelism
Data Level parallelism

LD	R1, #100
LD	R2, #101
LD	R3, #102
LD	R4,	#103
ADD	R5, R1, R2 where R1 and 2 are operands
SUB R6, R2, R3 where R2 and 3 are operands
MULT	R7, R3, R4
ADD	R8, R5, R7
SUB R9, R3, R4

Given proper hardware, some of the commands will be completed at the same
time.
Single instruction, Single Data(SISD) - no parallelism
Single instruction, Multiple Data(SIMD) - data parallelism
Multiple instruction, Multiple Data(MIMD) - independant tasks/threads
