Late 1960s
	Transition from Discrete transistors to small-scale integrated
	circuits
	Mini-computers(16-bit datapath, price more in range of $10,000
	to $100,000 rather than $100,000 to $1M): Data General, Digital
	Equipment Corp, supported a single or a few interactive users
	with CRTs
1970s
	IBM had a lock on mainframe market: US Anti-trust litigation
	Department-sized units, small-businesses had minicomputers
	(size of a fridge or two)
	Invention of the microprocessor: Intel 8008, first CPU on a
	single chip
	Large-scale integration(LSI) - 20-50k transistors on a chip
	Microcomputers: single user, 8-bit CPU, 4-6k memory, $1-5k.
	Unix OS developed by ATT/Bell Labs runs on DEC minicomputers,
	ported to many others
1980s
	Original IBM PC: 1981, killer app was the spreadsheet
	8-bit and 16-bit microprocessors (reprise of mainframe history
	on sigle chips)
	Minicomputers: DEC VAX 11/780 ( 1 MIPS, by definition) 
	Core memory replaced by DRAM
	Intel 386: watershed, supported memory protected in hardware
1990s
	Workstations with 32-bit processors (Sun microsystems, Data Geeneral
	Apollo, HP) running versions of Unix
	Development of Linux, open source version of UNix that runs on Intel
	386 or later CPUs 
	...
2000-2010s
	Intel's 32 bit architecture finally deprecated ( VLIW based IA-64
	fails because of lack of backward compatibility with IA-32)
	Rise of importance of mobile and embedded systems (mostly running
	ARM CPUs, based on BBC Acorn, modified to be a RISC)
	Power consumption and clock distribution limit speed of CPUs
	Ever-bigger caches
State of the art
	Feature size (smallest thing that can be redered in silicon) 7nm
	5 nm is the theoretical limit - quantum tunneling begins
	Uniprocessor clock speed; 4-5 GHz (flawed measure of performance)
	Power consumption heat disipation
Future directions
	portacble devices
	multi-core chips
	parallel clusters
	GPU based genral purpose computing
	
DEC PDP-8 (1968)
	single accumulator register
	no other registers
	12 bit datapath 
	12 bit address bus (4K memory) 
	magnetic core
	SSI (10-12 gates/chip ) integrated circuit 

Intel 8080 (1976) 
	accumulator and B,C,D,E,H,L registers
	8 bit datapath
	16 bit address bus
	semiconductor memory (DRAM) 
	VLSI integrated circuit (~50K transistors/chip) 
	chip size is 20 mm^2

Intel Core i7 (2012)
	64 bit data and address bus
	32 bit compatibility mode
	AMD 64 mode
	4 CPU core on one chip
	3 GHz clock speed 
	8 MB cache on chip
	chip size 146 mm^2?
	over 1 million transistors
	
RISC-V (2007)
	64 bit 
	32 general purpose integer registers
	32 floating point registers
