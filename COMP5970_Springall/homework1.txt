# Problem 1
As head of the TSA, you set the rules for screening passengers at airport checkouts.

__Assumptions__
* It is my job to protect the passengers, airlines, and staff of the airport
* I must be able to screen people without overly invading their privacy

__Assets__
* The passengers and airport/line staff - people are an asset for TSA
* The airplanes - the planes are assets of the airports and losing those is a bad look for TSA
* The resources held by the airport (gasoline, land, etc.) - Those resources are expected to be protected by TSA,
   as airports rely on TSA and occasionally local police for security

__Threats__
* Plane hijackers - people who want to steal airplanes for their own purposes (terrorism, joy, monetary)
* People with vandettas against (other passengers, airlines, etc.) - some people want to get revenge against a person
   or company so much so that they may want to take drastic measure to enact that revenge
* People wanting the resources of the airport (gasoline, land, etc.) - in the case that the United States is under attack
   from another nation, airports and naval ports are going to be assets that the attacking country may want in order to get
   their soldiers onto American soil

__Countermeasures to Implement__
* Scanning and screening of employees such that the  employees of TSA are able to handle the importance and stress of the
   jobs that they are given.
* Screening of people in the airport for any type of weapons on their person
* Deeply scanning and checking suspicious bags for any type of possible remote weapons for damaging the planes
* Screening peoples on person baggage for any types of dangerous items
* Having air marshalls on flights to protect passengers and pilots while plane is in flight (ideally every flight)

__Countermeasures not to Implement__
* Psycho(logical) screening every passenger to try and find any possible motives to attack passengers, staff, or airlines
* Having a National Guard and Air National Guard outpost at airports in order to protect from possible invasions
* Requiring that passengers not have any form of protection on luggage so that TSA officers can thoroughly parse
   trough items
   
# Problem 2
Your fraternity, sorority, or student group is electing officers for next year via an online system.

__Assumptions__
* It is my responsibility to maintain the integrity of the votes
* I only want active members of my fraternity/sorority to vote
* The platform that I use to host the election is secure
* Those that are running for office are not able to vote for themselves

__Assets__
* The server that is hosting the election site
* Financial resources of the fraternity/sorority that go into hosting the election site
* Confidentiality of what each member votes

__Threats__
* Someone who is running that wants to falsely skew the votes in their favor
* Non-members of the fraternity/sorority wanting to participate in the vote

__Countermeasures to Implement__
* Research the platform that you will be using to host the election for any vulns that could lead to modifications
   of the votes, leaking of vote information, allowing non-members to participate, allowing code execution on the server
* Implement or use a secondary platform for authentication of members. Allows us to ensure that only members of the fraternity/sorority
   are able to vote.
* Also research the authentication platform for vulns
* Limit what computers will be allowed to access the voting page. This will allow us to monitor the voting physically

__Countermeasures not to Implement__
* Use physical voting. We already have stated that we want to do electronic voting 
* Shoulder-surf every voter to ensure that no malicious activity is being done during a vote. Unreasonable
* Implementing monitoring systems to check for and alert for breaches. This could be too expensive to implement and maintain
   given the length of the vote.
   
# Problem 3
As a lab admin, I would like to ensure that only students that need access to the lab have access to its resources.

__Assumptions__
* It is my job to ensure that the property of the lab is not used improperly
* It is my job to ensure that lab materials are not taken outside of the lab without proper approval
* It is my job to ensure all that are in the lab and have access to the lab are authenticated

__Assets__
* Lab materials (computers, tools, etc.)
* Intellectual Property of the researchers in the lab

__Threats__
* Careless people
* People who want to steal the lab materials for profit
* People who want access to the intellectual property held within the lab without proper authentication

__Countermeasures to Implement__
* Limit points of entry and exit to the lab
* On the few entry/exit points, use a(some) form(s) of authentication (magswipe, bio, pin code)
* ensure authentication is enabled on all possible technology within the lab (domain login for computers, etc)
* Implement anti-stealing cables for desktop computes
* Implement secure storage of small items within the lab lockable drawers etc. 
* Security cameras within the lab to identify potential thieves

__Countermeasures no to Implement__
* Have armed security present in the labs at all times
* Perform bag checks on people entering and exiting the lab
* Have 24/7 monitoring of all security and monitoring systems
* Completely remove all access to the lab
