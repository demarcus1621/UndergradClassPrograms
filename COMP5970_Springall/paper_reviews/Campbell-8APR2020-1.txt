SoK: Research Perspectives and Challenges for Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies

This paper is the first attempt at a formal research paper that takes a look
into the Bitcoin cryptocurrency. The paper attempts to dismantle naive arguments
about Bitcoin and its stability due to them not having a firm theoretical
grounding. One such naive approach states that Bitcoin, "works in practice, but
not in theory." The authors argue that their research aims to prove that research
is needed in order to back the many claims about Bitcoin, and to determine whether
or not the claim that Bitcoin will maintain stability based on the practice(s)
of its users as said practices change. The main contributions that this paper
states are: this paper being the first systematic approach to the analysis of
Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, provide comparative analysis on different
parts of the Bitcoin infrastructure, enumerate anonymity issues in the Bitcoin,
and the authors propose a new protocol, which eliminate the need for trusted
intermediates based on the use case.

The main strengths of this paper is that it explains some of the possible
attacks that can be taken against the Bitcoin infrastructure and the in depth
explanation of how the Bitcoin infrastructure is layed out. The main weakness
that I found with this paper is how dry it is. The first 1/4 of the paper is
spent explaining the Bitcoin infrastructure, which I do not feel is integral
into understanding the topic of Bitcoin during later sections of the paper.
The in depth explanation of Bitcoin could have been in portions as those
portions were needed for clarification of the topic at hand. I feel like
this paper can be expanded upon by performing a deep analysis of the different
attacks that were discussed in this paper and the feasiblity of the attack.
