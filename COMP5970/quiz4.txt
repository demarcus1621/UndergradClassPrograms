Quiz #4

1. Define each of the firmware extensions provided.
 - *.img: raw binary disk image
 - *.trx: uboot Legacy uImage
 - *.bin: raw binary data

2. What is the difference between firmware extensions?
*.bin files are raw data while *.trx and *.img are files that contain
compressed raw binary data.

3. What model number correlates with each file?
 - dir300-firmware.bin: D-Link Wireless G Router (DIR-300)
 - AC2100-V1.2.0.42_1.0.1.img: Netgear Nighthawk (AC2100)
 - RT-AC51U_3.0.0.4_380_8497-g179ec32.trx: ASUS Dual-Band AC750 (RT-AC51U)
 
4. What filesystem is being used by the firmware?
Each firmware is using the Squash file system.

5. What compression scheme are being used by each firmware?
 - dir300-firmware.bin: LZMA
 - AC2100-V1.2.0.42_1.0.1.img: LZMA + zip
 - RT-AC51U_3.0.0.r_380_8497-g179ec32.trx: LZMA

6. What kind of information contained within the filesystem can be used
during a penetration test?
After unsquashing the firmware, one can find private keys, default config
files, and leftover credentials. Considering that these firmware are for
consumer level routers, these devices are likely to not be changed/modded
by much after purchase, meaning that this information is likely to remain
upon deployment.
