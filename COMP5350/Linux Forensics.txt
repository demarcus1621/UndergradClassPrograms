Linux Forensics

What's Different about Linux
	No registry
		Have to gather sys info from scattered sources
	Different File System(of course)
		No file creation dates(until EXT4)
		Important metadata zeroed when files deleted
		All Android systems use EXT4 making it the most used
		file system in the world
	Files/Data are mostly plain text
		Good for string searching & interpreting data
	
Accessing the File System
	Can be complicated
	Encryption, RAID, Logical Volume Management
		LVM makes life difficult to find file locations
	Multiple partitions to mount

What should we look for
	/etc [%SystemRoot%/System32/config]
		primary system configuration directory
		separate configuration files/dirs for each app
	/var/log [Windows event logs]
		security logs, app logs, etc
		logs normally kept for about 4-5 weeks
	/home/$USER [%USERPROFILE%]
		user data and user configuration information
		
Basic System Profiling
Linux distro name/version number:
	/etc/*-release
Installation date
	Look at dates on /etc/ssh/ssh_host_*_key files
Computer name:
	/etc/hostname
IP address(es)
	/etc/hosts(static assignments)
	/var/lib/dhclient, /var/log/* (DHCP)
	
Default Time Zone
/etc/localtime stores default time zone data
Binary file format

Basic user data in /etc/passwd
	Any UID 0 account has admin privs
MD5 password hashes in /etc/shadow
	can be brute forced with John the ripper
/etc/sudoers may indicate users w/ admin privs
Group memberships in /etc/group

User login history
/var/log/wtmp
	shows user, source, time, and duration of login
	need to use Linux "last" command to view
Other logs that may contain user data
	/var/log/auth.log
	/var/log/secure
	/var/log/audit/audit.log

$HOME
/home/<user> is common convention
Home directory for admin user is /root

Web Browser Artifacts
Firefox and Chrome are common browsers
File formats are the same as Windows
Files under home directory

Nautilus
	Linux graphical file browser
	similar to windows explorer
	
Command History
$HOME/.bash_history
Not time stamped && can be modified by the user

Sudo history in:
	/var/log/auth.log
	/var/log/sudo.log
	
SSH
standard remote login service
useful files in $HOME/.ssh
	known_hosts - hosts user connected to from here
	authorized_keys - public keys used for logins to here
	id_rsa - private keys used to login elsewhere

Things to watch out for
	Persistence mechanisms
	Back doors
	other suspicious files and directories
	
Persistence Mechanisms
Service start-up scripts
	/etc/inittab, /etc/init.d, /etc/rc.d
	/etc/init.conf, /etc/init
Scheduled tasks
	/etc/cron*
	/var/spool/cron/*
	
Back Doors
Deliberate malware/Trojan horse install
In /etc/passwd and in /etc/shadow
	Extra UID 0 accounts
	"Application" accounts with active passwords
New $HOME/.ssh/authorized_keys entries
Back doors via inetd
	/etc/inetd.conf
	/etc/xinetd.conf, /etc/xinetd.d
	
Rogue "set-UID" files
Directories w/ names that start with "."
Regular files under /dev directory
Recently modified files
Large files(> 10 MB)
