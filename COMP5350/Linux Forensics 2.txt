Linux Forensics
Open source operating system(GPL). Modification and redistribution
of source code. The first version of Linus was released in 1991.
Although not derived directly from Unix-based operating systems,
Linux was developed to be functionally similar to Unix. Each Linux
instance contains common components
	Bootloader
	Kernel
	Shell(s)
	CLI
	GUI
	Applications
	
Linux Distros
There are currently 285 Linux distributions in use. Each Linux
distribution combines different software, projects, and libraries.
Pre-compiled and tested software packages are known as repos.

Linux Shells
Access to Linux kernel and user spaces can be accomplished through
a CLI. Linux Shell examples:
	Bourne Again SHell
	C-Shell
	TEXEX Shell
	Z-Shell
	
Available Shells
Each distro has a default list of shells installed with the kernel.
It will be necessary to use software package installers to add
shells outside of the default list.

BASH
BASH includes the basic features common to all linux shells

C Shell(csh)
Created by Bill Joy of UC Berkeley. Objective was to created a 
shell with a 

TENEX Shell(tcsh)
Developed for the TEXEX operating system and to be compatible with
cs.

Korn Shell(ksh)
Released in 1993 at Bell Labs 

Forensic Value of Linux Shells
The Linux CLI is a powerful tool to identify forensically valuable
artifacts across a Linux OS. The CLI can identify numerous artifacts
including:
	Bootloaders
		MBR UEFI GRUB INITRD
	Linux Filesystem Contents
		ext2 ext3 ext4
	Directory/File Structure
	Services & Scheduled Tasks
	Installed Software and packages
	
Basic Linux Commands
	whoami
	hostname
	uname
	time
	date
	type
	history(!!)
	
Environment Variables
Environment variables(EV) are values assigned within a shell and used
by the operating system. 

Linux Searches
There are numerous Linux search commands that can be used in the analysis
of a Linux system:
	strings
		Display printable strings in file(s)
	srch_strings
		Displays printable strings in file(s) along with disk offset
		Sleuth Kit commands
	grep
		Global Regular Expression Printer
	awk
		shell scripting language to manipulate and filter data
	sed
		stream editor used to manipulate and filter text form files or
		pipelines

Search strings
The search strings command, srch_strings, extends the following 

Regular Expressions for Forensics
Let's look at some common data artifacts that can be identified during
a forensics investigation.

File Expressions

Network Information
There are numerous network related artifacts that can be collected
during a forensic analysis. All 7 of the OSI layers have known
formats that can be ...
