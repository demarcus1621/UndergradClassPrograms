Introduction to File Systems
A file system provides the data structures necessary
to store and retrieve data. Data in a file system is
configured into different hierarchal structures that
array file and directories. The layers of a file
system are:
	Data Unit
		Containers that hold file contents
		Cluster/Block
	Metadata
		Data that describes a file
			References to file storage location
			File size
			MAC time
	File Name

File Access
When a disk partition is created, the file system
establishes how the data is structured along with
metadata. File systems usually work on blocks or
clusters.
	1 sector - 512 bytes
	Block size - 1 - 128 sectors depending on the
	file system
...

Essential File System Data
Essential file system data are those needed to save and
retrieve files
	Reference addresses for accessing data
	Filenames
	Pointers to metadata
Additional, but non-essential file system data, include:
	File access times
	File permissions
The delineation between essential and non-essential ...

FAT File System
The File Allocation Table file system is a basic file
systems. FAT is the principal file system used by legacy
Windows OS
	MS DOS
	Windows 9*
	
FAT12
	12-bit FAT entries
	Cluster sizes form 512 Bytes - 4 KB
	Partitions smaller than 16 MB
	Legacy file system
FAT16
	...
	
Organization of a FAT Partition
The simplicity of FAT is based on the small number of 
data structures used
	Reserved Area - Boot sector code
		Number of FATs
		Sector Sizes
		Number of sectors in a cluster
	FAT Area(s)
		Table with one entry for each cluster in the partition
		Multiple FATs are generated for redundancy
	Root Directory
		Fixed location for FAT12 and FAT16 partitions
		FAT32 has a root directory but is stored in the data
		area
	Data Area
		Contains "Directory Entry Structure" which provides
		locations for files and directories
		
FAT supports only four ...

FAT16 Partition
16-bit entries
1 entry for each cluster
	Free cluster ( 0x0000 )
	Occupied Cluster
		0x0002 - 0xFFFF
		...
		
		
Creating Test Disks
Identify Current Disk Parameters
	Use fdisk to identify file systems and partitions currently on
		the disk you are going to create
	Select the correct disk
	fdisk m
	d	Deletes any partitions
	n 	Creates new partition
	w 	Writes changes to the disk
	Check: sudo fdisk -l
