Concentrations:
	Device analysis
	OS
	File System
	LAN
	Perimeter Network

Digital Forensics Science Framework
For any scientific discipline, there are several
important considerations that must be met:
	Theory
		An agreed set of principles on how the science works
	Process
		Systematic observation, measurement, and testing process
	...

Digital Forensics - The use of scientifically derived and proven methods
toward the preservation, collection, validation, identification, analysis,
interpretation, documentation, and presentation of digital evidence 

6-Step Process:
1) Identify
2) Preserve
3) Collect
4) Examine
5) Analyze
6) Present

Trustworthiness
Digital media and data can be manipulated and require a trustworthiness
process of collecting and storing artifacts
Methods that can be used to ensure data trustworthiness:
	Work from an exact copy of the original data
	Preserve the data pedigree
		Hash
		Collection time
		Time Offsets
	Employ Cryptography as a partial solution
		Digital signatures - Asymmetric
		Encryption - Symmetric and Asymmetric
	Understand application meta-data
	Apply corroborating evidence
	
Detection and Recovery of Hidden Data Definitions
	Steganography - hiding data within other sets of data
		OpenStego, Xiao
	Covert Channels - Modulation of data in a manner that allows 
	data to be indirectly transmitted and prevents detection and
	analysis
	File Slack - remaining sectors to the end of a cluster, which 
	is the smallest addressable data element for a file system
	RAM Slack - is the slack between the end of the logical file
	and the sector
	Hidden Partitions - a partition is a unique region on a storage
	media that an operating system can manage. Hidden ones are generally
	used to restore the default system settings, but can be manipulated
	Unallocated Space:
		Allocated Space - contains data, and is marked so that it cannot
		be overwritten
		Unallocated Space - may or may not contain data, and is marked so
		that it can be overwritten
	Protocols - Requests for Comments(RFC) specify the technical parameters
	of communication protocols
	System Boot:
		Basic Input/Output System(BIOS)
			Master Boot Record(MBR)
				Single Boot Sector
				512 byte disk sectors
				4 partition limit
				2 TB maximum addressable space
		Unified Extensible Firmware Interface(UEFI)
			Globally Unique Identifier(GUID) Partition
				...
	RAM - Lots of Stuff
	
Digital Forensics Legal Considerations
The US DoJ published a reference guide for first responders of electronic crimes
in 2008. It specifies 14 crime categories and 60 different types of digital
evidence. NOTE: Any electronic device that can internally or externally save
data can result in digital evidence.

Federal Rules of Evidence(FRE)
Enacted by Public Law 93-595 and approved Jan. 2, 1975
FRE Articles Include:
	Article VI - Witnesses
	...

FRE Best Evidence
Best Evidence - FRE 1001
	For electronically stored information, "original"
	means any printout - or other output readable by 
	sight if it accurately reflects the information
	
Computer Generated vs. Computer Stored Records
	Computer Generated - data generated by a computing system or program, and is
	considered direct evidence - FRE 803
	Computer Stored - records or documents generated by a user, is considered
	as hearsay unless corroborated
	
Evidence Collection and Archiving
Guidelines for Evidence Collection and Archiving:
	RFC 3227 specifies best practices for digital evidence collection and storage
	RFC 3227 - Order of Volatility
		CPU Cache and Registers 
		Routing Tables/ARP Cache/Process Tables/Kernal Statistic/RAM
		Temporary File Systems/Swap Space
		Remote Logging/System Monitoring Data
		Physical Configuration/Network Topology
		Archival Media
		
RFC 3227 specifies 5 legal considerations when presenting digital evidence:
	Admissible - it must conform to certain rules before it can be used in court
	Authentic - It must be possible to positively tie evidential material to the
	incident
	Complete - It must tell the whole story
	...
	
Digital Evidence Collection
	Capture System Image
		Take forensic images of all systems and devices
		Live vs. dead collection
		bit-by-bit copy
	Document Network Traffic and Logs
		Analyze network connections and system logs
		Record MAC times(Modified, Accessed, and Created Times)
	Record Time Offset
		Note local vs. standard time offsets
	Calculate Hashes
		Images - Files - Logs
		Hash types(MD5, SHA256, SHA512)
		
Additional Forensics Evidence Collection Activities
	Capture Screenshots
	Interview Witnesses
	Track Man-hours and Expenses
	
Digital Forensics and Incident Response
Threat Actors
	Advanced Persistent Threat(APT) - Highly trained, and tend to be representative
	of some government organization
	Technical - Highly skilled hacker without any government backing
	Profit - Cyber criminal
	Hacktivists - Accomplish for political agenda
	Malicious Insider - self explanatory 
Incident Response
	Digital forensics will be applied baed on the identified threat and organizational
	policy
	Incident - activities launched against organizational resources that attempt to gain
	unauthorized access
	
Incident Response Policy
At a minimum, an incident response policy must include:
	Incident Identification - tools and procedures to detect threats
	Incident Investigation - trained personnel
	Incident Damage Repair - remediation of incident damage
	Documenting Organizational Response - document all technical and administrative
	procedures
	Update Training
	
Incident Response Personnel
	First Responders
		Physical vs. Network Security
	Incident Response Teams
		How are teams established
			By function
			Dictated by Incident
		What training is required

Chain of Custody
To ensure proper control of all collected evidence it is necessary to develop a effective
handling process
