Virtualization Definitions
	Hypervisor - a software, firmware, or hardware
	solution that creates and runs virtual machines
		Type 1: Bare Metal
			Runs independent of the OS
		Type 2: Hosted
			Dependant on the OS
	Provision - allocation of host resources for guest
	Clone - Replica or copy of a virtual machine for
	either backup or operational purposes
	Snapshot - Image capture of a virtual machine; Allow
	quick rollback of a VM due to corruption or misconfiguration
	Sandboxing - separation of guest resources from external sources
	
File System Abstraction
Logical analysis of any file system should include definitions for:
	Disk
		Physical Storage Device
			SCSI
			SATA
			SD
	Partition
		Logical separation for a disk
		Partition: single disk
		Volume: multiple disks
	File System
		Defines file layout and meta-data on the partition
		Each partition/volume has a file system
	Data Units
		The smallest addressable data element
		512 bytes -> 4 KB
	Meta-data
		Data about data units
		Windows
			File ID
		Linux
			Inode
	File Name
		User space naming

Disk
Mass Storage Devices(3 main categories)
	Magnetic Media
	Non-Volatile Memory(Flash)
	Optical Media
		CD, DVD, Blu-Ray
Hard Disk Drives - Traditional hard disks depend on physical
geometry of the drive
	Heads
	Platters
	Tracks
	Sectors per track
Data location on the disk is derived utilizing Logical Block Addresses(LBA)
Recall that disk are the smallest addressable data element
	512 bytes -> 4 KB
File deletion only unlinks references to data

Hard Disk Drive Forensic Considerations
When conducting a forensic analysis, there are forensic considerations when
dealing with magnetic media
	Physical vs Logical disks
		physical - geometry
		logical - partitions / volumes
	Address Mapping
		Cylinder-Head-Mapping
		...
		
Magnetic Tapes
Generally used for backup and archiving purposes in enterprise environments
Magnetic tapes provide a stable media that can be used for long-term offline
storage
Sequential read and write, no random access
Each file contains its own file system
Read and written with SCSI commands
Once written to, each archive is marked with an end of data(EOD) marker

Non-Volatile Memory
Flash Erase Electronically Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory(Flash)
Transistors making up mass storage devices can be composed of AND,OR, NAND
...

Solid State Drives
Solid state drives are fundamentally different than traditional hard disks
NAND-based storage does not suffer from physical ware

SOlid State Drive Forensic Considerations
When conducting a forensic analysis, there are forensic considerations
when dealing with non-volatile memory
	Unallocated Space
		Unlike standard hard disk drives, unallocated space is usually erased
		with TRIM in preparation for future writes whcih prevents recovery of
		data
	Address Mapping
		Unlike standard hard disk drives, solid state drives us dynamic addressing
		of logical to physical blocks
		
USB Flash Drives
Universal Serial Bus
NAND or NOR technology
USB flash drives can be formatted with most common file systems:
	FAT
	exFAT
	NTFS
	extX
	
USB SCSI Protocols
USB access storage devices with two modes:
	Bulk Only Transport(BOT) mode
		Legacy, lower performance mode
	USB Attached SCSI Protocol(USASP)
	...
	
USB Flash Drives Forensic Considerations
Potential hiding techniques will be dependent on file system used
USB flash drives are coded with:
	Vendor ID
	Product ID
	
Removable Memory Card Types
Removable memory card are used extensively in numerous applications and have
multiple formats
	xD
		Extreme Digital
		Digital Photo applications
	...
	
Optical Storage Media
Different methods of reading and writing
	Read-Only Memory(ROM)
	Write-Once Read Many(WORM)
	Read-Writable(RW)
Compact Disk Types
	...
	
Compact Disk Forensic Considerations
Unlike standard HDDs which have EOD and Host Protected Areas(HPA) that prevent
direct user access, optical media can be read but CD filesystems may require
specific analysis tools

Digital Versatile Discs
DVDs are single of double sided with a 120-mm diameter and 1.2-mm thickness and
composed of 2048 byte sectors
Can be configured with Digital Rights Management(DRM) protection measures included
encryption

Blu-Ray Discs
Just like CD and DVD discs, blue-ray is composed of 2048 byte sectors

Media Detection and Configuration
External Media Detection
	Connect Drive to Host
	Connect Drive to Guest
	Available Devices
	Auto mount vs Read only
	Write Blocking
	
Media Detection and Access
/dev - Device file repository
dmesg - kernal level driver messages
lsblk - list block devices
lockdev - block device system calls
lsscsi - list SCSI disk attributes
lsusb - list USB buses 
fdisk - disk format
df - disk space
hdparm - display and set drive parameters
hexdump(xxd) - dump file contents in hex


Partition
SCSI device files listing disks and partitions
Disks
	/dev/sda - first disk
	/dev/sdb - second disk
Partitions
	/dev/sda1 - first disk, first partition
	``
